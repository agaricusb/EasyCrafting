## Welcome to the Easy Crafting repository

Easy Crafting is a Minecraft mod that provides similar functionality to the now out of date mods like Crafting Table II (by ljdp) and Crafting Table III (by Zeldo).

I also plan to extend its functionality and usefulness by implementing new features and compatibility with popular mods.

If you have a mod that Easy Crafting is not working properly with, please submit an issue (and/or a pull request to fix it) and the accompanying crash report (if there is one).
